Instead of doing these hard problems, I'd rather solve some problems with something I don't know yet.
This way I can learn something and make it my own.
Because some experienced people said that these hard problems need generaly abilities. But now I lack some basic knowledge about someting.
So I'm going to solve problems that require some knowledge I don't know yet. And I can improve from solving them.
Just like the last one, I learnt something about directed acyclic graph and its topological sorting.
That's great experience.

Firstly, I thought we should use a linkedlist but didn't know how to determine whether it's going to be infinite loop.
So, the input is a queue, but now we turn it into a circle, we see it as a circle.They now stand in a circle.
If the king wins, swap these two element, otherwise don't swap. But, the king always move clockwise.
