——I saw you playing basketball this afternoon. How is it going with yiur shooting skill?

—-I watched some basketball tutorial vedios last night. And I made some adjustmentss. So I acted. I put them into practicality to see whether it’s going to work. I practiced for almost two hours. Standing so near the bottom of the rim. And it turned out pretty hard to shoot it that way. However, I extended my shooting range very easily with that shooting form. Time flies. I was so focued on it. Then, just a moment ago, some guy older than me joined, shooting it very hard, which I don’t like because I feel pain for my basketball. So, I quit. 

——Okay, imitating the great and put the adjsutments into reality.
