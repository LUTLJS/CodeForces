——You were shooting the ball from a very long distance and you missed them all. How does you feel now?

——I was trying to extend my shooting distance, so very shot I missed is a stepstone in the long run. That felt challenging. But I am sure I’ll get used to it. So, tonight is a big night for me. I challenged myself. I put myself out of my comfort zone. This is what we called progress. Another thing, I did the follow-through all the time when I was practicing even though sometimes I did not do it perfectly. I am making progress and this is what motivates me.
