Dynamic programming is about breaking down problems into pieces and storing the sub-solutions for future use in order to reduce the repeated steps 
of same computation. This technique is called memoization. It means we remmember the previous results so that in the future we encounter them again, we can
just look it up and directly reuse it instead of computing it again.
Update the optimal solution as we move on.
